          VantaJax is a focused directory for Black-owned businesses in
          Jacksonville, Florida. The goal is simple: make it easier for people
          to intentionally support Black owners, professionals, and community
          spaces without having to dig through scattered lists and social posts.

            Why this exists
          </h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            It’s often said that the price of community is inconvenience. Finding
            and supporting Black-owned businesses usually means word-of-mouth,
            random Instagram posts, or out-of-date spreadsheets. VantaJax is
            meant to cut through that and give people a single, living place to
            start.

            What VantaJax focuses on
          </h2>
          <ul class="space-y-1.5 text-slate-300">
            <li>• Businesses that are actually in Jacksonville and nearby areas.</li>
            <li>• Owners who identify their business as Black-owned.</li>
            <li>• Transparency around what’s verified and what’s community-submitted.</li>
            <li>• Making it easy for anyone to suggest places that should be on the radar.</li>

            How this will grow
          </h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            VantaJax is starting simple: a searchable directory, featured spots,
            and a suggestion form. Over time, the plan is to add better
            filtering, richer profiles for businesses, and tools for owners to
            manage their own listings.

            Want to help?
          </h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            The easiest way to support this is by using it: search for local
            spots, share the directory, and suggest businesses that should be
            here. If you’d like to collaborate or have ideas, you can start by
            submitting a business and mentioning that in the notes.
