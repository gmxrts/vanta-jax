          Why this exists
        </h2>
        <p>
          A lot of us want to support Black-owned spaces, but actually finding them can be
          confusing, fragmented, or based on word of mouth. VantaJax helps take out some of
          that friction by curating a focused, local-first directory that you can search and
          contribute to.

          VantaJax is starting in Jacksonville, but the long-term goal is to grow the
          platform, improve the data, and add more ways for people to discover, share, and
          support Black-owned businesses where they live.
